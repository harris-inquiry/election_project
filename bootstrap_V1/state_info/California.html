    <p>You must register to vote at least 15 days before the election you wish to vote in, or you can register during the early voting period or on Election Day (see more under “Election Day Registration”).</p>
    <p>If you’re eligible to vote in California but have not yet registered, you can go to your polling location and register on the day of the election.</p>
    <h5 style="font-weight:bold">Vote-by-mail & Absentee</h5>
    <p>No excuse is needed to vote by mail in California. Due to COVID-19, all registered voters in California will automatically receive vote by mail ballots for the November 2020 election, so you do not need to request a vote by mail ballot. Register to vote or check your registration status to ensure you receive your ballot.</p>
