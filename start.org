* Inbox
Father asked me to make him some websites for the Election

** TODO Need to be able to serve dynamic HTML pages to users

Non-Webapp

** Bootstrap
CSS/HTML library 
+ Good for mobile structured sites


** DONE React + AngularJS
Propbably not the best ideas - way more in depth -> not completely necessary for a simple website


* Bootstrap
CSS library - prebuilt objects I can throw into the website - built for smartphones
/But, what objects do I want thrown in?/

** /How to use bootstrap?/
